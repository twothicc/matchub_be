## Setup Instructions

Install node version v16.13.2 and npm version 8.1.2

1. Run `chmod u+x setup.sh`, then run `./setup.sh`. This will install a MySQL server and setup a user with the necessary permissions for this demo.
2. In this directory, run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

**Note**: It is highly recommended to uninstall the MySQL server afterwards since this is very insecure.
